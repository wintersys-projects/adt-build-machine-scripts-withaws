# Description : If you use a managed database, then part of the security procedures
# might include a security group, so for our webservers to be able to access our
# database we need to grant them access using their ip address.
# Note: make sure any databases you created in the cloud are given public access capabilities
# as a general thing and we then restict access using ip addresses
