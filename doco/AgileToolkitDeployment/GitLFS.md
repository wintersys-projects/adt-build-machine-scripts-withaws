When making backups (but not baselines) of your databases using this toolkit, it makes use of a service called Git LFS. 
Regular repositories are limited in size and so if your database grows it won't fit in. 
You can use Git LFS to offload your assets so that you can store larger databases in your git system.
You can find out more about GitLFS at:
