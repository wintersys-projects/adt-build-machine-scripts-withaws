The native firewalling systems tend to have limits to them like 50 rules per firewall.
What this means is that the firewall system for the current provider will limit how many webservers you can have running because there needs to be rules for each webserver therefore if the provider allows 50 firewall rules, then, the way things are right now, that means you can have:  

max mnumber of webservers=50 / Number of rules per webserver
